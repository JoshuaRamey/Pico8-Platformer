# Pico-8 Platformer

A simple platforming game made in Pico-8. Currently this game is a work in progress, so far I have accomplished:

1) Drawing a player object to the screen.
2) Adding character movement (Running, jumping, sliding, falling).
3) Animating the player object during movement (Running, jumping, and falling).
4) Drawing map tiles to the screen.
5) Adding gravity and friction.
6) Collisions with map tiles.

### Todo:

1) Add a camera to move and follow the player.
2) Build out the full map.
3) Improve map collision for different block types.
4) Improve movement and physics.
5) Add enemy characters.

##Controls:

• Use the left and right arrow keys to move

• Press X to jump

If you walk off the edge of the screen you will fall off the map. Currently there is no logic go restart in this scenario
so you will need to refresh the page in order to restart.
